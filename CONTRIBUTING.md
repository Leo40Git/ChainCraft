# Contributing Guidelines
### Creating an issue
Make sure you're using the latest version of the mod and a reasonably recent version of Forge!  
FoamFix or OptiFine shouldn't affect the mod, so there's no need to point out that they're installed.
### Creating a pull request
Make sure all Java code is tab indented and refrain from adding dependencies.
